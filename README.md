# MapAPI

MapAPI is a simple and easy-to-use service for developers who need to check APIs that provide geographic location data. This project is designed to help you fetch and validate information from location-based APIs in your applications.

## Features

- Fetch location data using an API endpoint
- Validate API responses for location accuracy
- Supports integration with multiple mapping services
- Built with modular and clean code for easy customization

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (v14 or higher) [or Python 3.x, adjust based on your project's language]
- npm, yarn, or your preferred package manager

### Installation

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/MapAPI.git
cd MapAPI
```

Install dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```
_or_
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Configuration

Set your API keys and endpoint URLs in the `.env` file (create this file in the root directory):

```
API_URL=https://your-location-api.com
API_KEY=your_api_key_here
```

### Usage

Import and use MapAPI in your project:

```javascript
const { getLocation } = require('./mapapi');

getLocation('1600 Amphitheatre Parkway, Mountain View, CA').then(location => {
  console.log(location);
});
```

_or in Python:_

```python
from mapapi import get_location

location = get_location('1600 Amphitheatre Parkway, Mountain View, CA')
print(location)
```
